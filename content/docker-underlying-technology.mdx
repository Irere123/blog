Docker is written in Go and built on top of **linux kernnel namespaces and cgroups**
to deliver its functionality. Namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container
runs in a seperate namespace.

Without going too deep yet, let's first get a refreshment on some of the docker concepts.

- A container, think it as a single package that contains everything needed to run a process. For example it can contain
  a Node environment, the backend code, and the compiled React code.

  Any machine that runs a container using that image, will be able to run
  the application without needing anything else pre-installed on the
  host machine other than docker.

- An Image is read-only meaning once you have created an image you can not change its content and you would need to build a new one for
  those changes to take effect. It's a template for creating a Docker container often an image is based on an image with some additional personal touches.

- A `Dockerfile` is a text-based script with simple syntax similar to usual linux commands. It provides instruction
  set on how to build the image. Each instruction in the dockerfile creates a layer in the image, when you change the Dockerfile
  and rebuild the image only the layers that have changed will be rebuilt.

### What is a container ?

A container is a sandboxed process running on host machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.
This isolation of a process in Docker under the hood is using `Kernel namespaces` and `cgroups`

> cgroups and kernel namespaces are tools in the linux system that helps to own isolated processes

- Wikipedia defines Namespaces as a feature of the Linux kernel that partition kernel resources such that one set of processes
  sees one set of resources, while another set of processes sees a different set of resources

Isolating processes from each service and its associated processes from other services means that there is a smaller **blast radius for changes**. If there is
an error, the effects of that error stays in that process and does not affect other services running.

Containers gives developers isolated environment that looks and feels like a VM, but it not a VM - It's a process running somewhere on the server.
Namespaces and cgroups are like I said are features of the Linux kernel then how does Docker work on Windows and Mac OS

#### Docker on Windows and Mac OS

So Docker uses namespaces and they are unique to the Linux kernel. Now you wonder, how Docker is able to work on MacOS and Windows machines?

Answer is simple: Docker runs a virtual machine in your local machine. When you install Docker Desktop it uses `VirtualBox` under the hood to run a linux virtual machine.

#### Containers and VMs

Containers create an illusion that could make you think you that you're actually running a virtual machine on your host but this is far from the truth
.

With a virtual machine you're booting a new OS distribution on your machine with a difference that this OS will make calls to a middleware provided by a virtualization engine like (VirtualBox or Qemu).
This middleware translates kernel calls to a sytem call that your host can understand

<Callout emoji="🧐">
  A system call (a.k.a syscall) is a computer program requesting a service from
  the OS on which it's running. services include, accessing hard disk drive,
  creation and execution of new process and communition of intergral kernel
  services
</Callout>

On other hand Linux containers make use of Linux namespaces to provide an illusion of running a different operating system by creating an isolated process that can have it's own user, file system and application and their dependencies.

## Namespaces

There are many types of linux kernel namespaces and every type of namespace will isolate a different set of resources on our system let's look at few important ones:

- **User namespace**: Contains an independent set of user IDs and group IDs that can be assigned to processes
- **PID namespaces**: Contains its own set of processes IDs. Every time you create a new namespace you will get assigned PID1. Every child process created under the same namespace will get subsequent PIDs
- **Mount namespace**: allow management of mount points in our system. Doing an unmount in our namespace won't have
  any effect on the main host as every new mount will be private to the namespace.

> A mount point is a directory on a file system that is logically linked to another file sytem. Mount points are used to make the data on a diffent physical storage drive easily available in a folder structure.
> mount points are comman in Unix, Linux, and macOS Windows can use mount points but it is not common.

- **Network namespace**: Virtualizes the network stack for the new namespace. This means that the new namespace will have its own interfaces , private IPs, IP route table and socket.
- **IPC (Inter-process communication)**: Allow defined shared memory segments between processes within a namespace
  for interprocess communication, not interfering with other namespaces

- **CGroup(Control Groups)** namespaces: They limit resource usage in our system (CPU, memory, disk, etc) for a particular set of processes under the same namespace. (Very important in the containerization world of systems like Docker)

Like I said we have only scratched the surface there other types of namespaces. The following table shows the namespace types available on Linux.
The second column of the table shows the flag value that is used to specify the namespace type in various APIs. The last column is a summary of the resources that are
isolated by the namespace type.

    ],
  }}
/>

### Creating a simple namespace

```bash
unshare --user --pid --map-root-user --mount-proc --fork bash
```

We use the [unshare](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html) command in Linux to run a process in a new namespace. So with that above command what are we telling the Linux kernel to do?

- `--user`: create a new user namespace
- `--pid`: create a new pid namespace(but will fail if `--fork` is not specified)
- `--map-root-user`: wait to start the process until the current user running the unshare command gets mapped to the superuser in the new namespace.
- `--mount-proc`: option ensures that a new [proc(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) file system is mounted that contains information corresponding to the new PID namespaces.
- `--fork` or `-f`: Fork the specified program as a child process of unshare command rather than running it directly. It's required when creating a new PID namespace.

The root user in the namespace can not do any harm outside this namespace we created.

The use of namespaces is not transparent to the users, and that's why most Docker users don't understand containers in the way they actually are.

**There is is a considerable number of people in the sector that see containers as some sort of virtual machines that does not contain the kernel, but shares it with the host instead. This is a wrong understanding of docker containers.**

### Why namespaces?

Namespaces allows you to isolate resources. One troublesome resource won't take down the host compeletely, it'll only affect those processes in the same namespace. Also namespaces allow security because processes running, under a given namespace, won't give access to the whole system. Whatever the hacker does will always be contained within the boundaries of that namespace.

Now we have only scratched the surface and in the next series of this article we will look into volumes and demystify there inner working stay tuned of more follow or DM me in X(formerly Twitter) for updates and questions
