# Hello, Run

Here's your fist line of code in Run

```
print "Hello world";
```

Run's syntax is a member of the C family. There are no paretheses around the string because `print` is a built-in statement and
not a library function.

I am surely biased towards my own creation but I think Run's syntax is pretty clean.

## Purpose of the experiment

You might say why would anyone want to build a langauge I mean isn't that like stupid.
For the purpose the creating Run was for learning purpose only I don't want to create the next python or rust.
While creating this language and writing it in `C` I learned alot of really interesting things the first one was `Mark-Sweep Algorithm` for the GC(Garbage Collector)
this is algorithm works by marking the roots and all the nodes that connected to the root and mark them and sweep all those that are not reachable from the root. The above was my best learning
during this experiment but also implementing a `hash table` to store globals variables and string objects wast good...

Having worked in large Typescript and Elixir codebase I haven't worked in a large `C` codebase so implementing Run in C was a great learning experience of how you
can write good `C` but not best `C` codebase as a whole.
